Jim√©nez Finite Element Analysis

The purpose of this tool is to demonstrate how to set up and solve the 2D linear elasticity problem using the finite element method. This solver is intended for education purposes and is not optimized.

## Execution

To run this code, do...

```bash
python -B __main__.py
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests, execute:
```bash
python -B -m unittest
```
Ignore `-B` parameter if you don't mind generating `__pycache__` directories everywhere.
